HTML support
2019-06-03
<p>This post is written in HTML! This may not be very obvious yet, because the default style puts everything in monospace, and a wall of monospaced text looks pretty similar regardless of whether it comes from a HTML or TXT source file.</p>

<p>One obvious difference is that HTML files ignore carriage-return
(and blank lines in general)
so

if you actually want to start a new paragraph, you will need to use either the p or br tag.</p>

<p>Here are some cool HTML things for you to look at.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A list.
    <ul>
        <li>Lists can be nested!</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Here is a link to <a href="https://google.com">Google</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embedded images are supported too.</p>
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150&amp;text=Example" alt="Broken image!" />
<pre>
And here is some monospaced text in a "pre" block.  It doesn't look terribly different than the text above, because everything is monospace anyway, and long lines are configured to wrap even in a "pre".  One difference is that carriage returns ARE respected in a "pre", so things like ASCII art will work.  For best results, you will want to keep the art to less than 60 columns wide (or whatever width is specified in the default CSS file).

__     ______    _    ____  _             
\ \   / / ___|  / \  | __ )| | ___   __ _ 
 \ \ / / |  _  / _ \ |  _ \| |/ _ \ / _` |
  \ V /| |_| |/ ___ \| |_) | | (_) | (_| |
   \_/  \____/_/   \_\____/|_|\___/ \__, |
                                    |___/ 
</pre>

<p>That's all, folks!</p>
